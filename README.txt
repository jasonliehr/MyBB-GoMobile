MYBB GOMOBILE 1.1
-----------------
- This product is licensed under the GNU/GPL v3 license, meaning you are free to do anything within the scope of the license. Within this package, you should find a copy of the license titled 'License.txt'.
- This version is intended for use with MyBB 1.6.8. You will not receive support if you are not running at least this version, as things are likely to break.



WARNINGS: PLEASE READ BEFORE INSTALLING
---------------------------------------
- Before installing, please make a backup of your database and forum. This version implements some new installation features to reduce conflicts and has not been thoroughly tested, therefore caution should be exercised.



UPGRADING
---------
You must follow these steps to avoid any annoying issues from occuring.
- 1. Uninstall your current version of GoMobile completely (delete the theme as well), BEFORE uploading the new files. Each beta has it's own set of install/uninstall instructions, thus trying to uninstall one beta using another set of instructions will lead to errors about missing tables and such.
- 2. Delete all old GoMobile files to reduce clutter (optional, mainly just the images/mobile folder)
- 3. Upload the new files, overwriting any old ones
- 4. Install & Activate the new version



INSTALLATION
------------
- 1. Upload the contents of the "Upload" folder to the root of your forums, keeping the folder structure intact.
- 2. Visit your ACP > Configuration > Plugins sections and hit 'Install & Activate' for MyBB GoMobile



SUPPORT
-------
- If you require support with MyBB GoMobile, the best place to get it is at http://mybbgm.com
- Besides getting support for GoMobile, you can also report bugs and get the latest updates
- The "cutting edge" version of GoMobile, which may contain bugs, can be found on GitHub (to use, click the small gray "ZIP" button near the top of the page): https://github.com/Scoutie44/MyBB-GoMobile
-- Please be cautious when using any versions found on GitHub, since they are likely NOT thoroughly tested and may contain bugs


OTHER NOTES
-----------
- If you wish to limit GoMobile to certain usergroups, enable the corresponding setting in the GoMobile settings page and then set theme permissions as you would for any other theme
- You can use any combination of HTML/Text/Images in the "Mobile Board Name" field of the MyBBGM settings, although text-only is recommended for compatibility, speed and simplicity
- The "Theme ID" field of the MyBBGM settings area should have been filled automatically during installation; if it is not, visit the Templates & Style section of your Admin CP, and hover your mouse over the "MyBB GoMobile" theme. You will notice a number at the end of the URL, such as "tid=19"; this is the number (19) that you type into the Theme ID field



Thanks for using GoMobile!
